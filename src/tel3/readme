Output is in cm
with a moment of 1e25 dyne-cm
although this is just a guess


changes made by zhongwen and chur
do changes of t1 t2 o , and dif in fortrain, not in sac anymore
change the npts and dt  to save more time: ND0 in two .f, and dt in one .f
mute all output from tel3
change the output filename so that all can be easily moved to modelx/modelx_x/

after all of these, much faster 


---chur finds out that maximum number of layers is 10
more layers causes trouble


----this is now a cleaned version from Chur, with only one perl script
npts and dt can be changed without modifying the fortran code



#############wenbo modified sub.bodyw3.f ,based on the difference 
between eq 4.96 and 4.97 in Aki and Richard! Great!
